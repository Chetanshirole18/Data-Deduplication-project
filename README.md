The Data Deduplication project aims to identify and eliminate duplicate data entries from large datasets to optimize storage and improve data quality. It uses hashing and comparison algorithms to detect redundancy efficiently. This process reduces storage costs and enhances system performance. The project can be applied to file systems, databases, and backup systems.
